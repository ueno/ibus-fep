ibus-fep -- IBus client for text terminals

Usage:

If you compile ibus-fep from source, you will need to install the
libfep library avaliable from: http://github.com/ueno/libfep

After install, run ibus-daemon as needed:

$ ibus-daemon -rv --panel=disable &

Then, start ibus-fep with:

$ ibus-fep

To toggle IME on/off, type Control+\ (backslash).  The keybinding can
be customized with:

$ gconftool-2 --set /desktop/ibus/fep/toggle_shortcut --type string "Control+o"
