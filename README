ibus-fep -- IBus client for text terminals

Install:

If you compile ibus-fep from source, you will need to install the
libfep library avaliable from: http://github.com/ueno/libfep

Usage:

ibus-fep is merely an IBus client like the GTK IM module (im-ibus.so),
not a bus nor panel replacement.  So, before running ibus-fep, make
sure that ibus-daemon is running:

$ pgrep -lf ibus-daemon
2201 /usr/bin/ibus-daemon -r --xim

Otherwise, run it manually.  Please be aware that some of required
IBus component (ibus-gconf, etc.) may fail to start when dbus-daemon
is not running.  See the dbus-launch manual page to start dbus-daemon:

$ eval `dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session`
$ ibus-daemon

Then, start ibus-fep with:

$ XMODIFIERS= xterm -e ibus-fep

or:

$ XMODIFIERS= xterm -e ibus-fep -- nano

To switch between IMEs, use the same hotkey as IBus used under X
window system, typically Control+Space.  The keybinding can be
customized with ibus-setup command (or with <hotkeys> element in
/usr/share/ibus/*.xml).

Limitations:

* IMEs which expect X keycodes (ibus-hangul, etc.) cannot be used

* Some keys (for example, Hiragana_Katakana, etc.) are not recognized
  because of tty limitation.  If you use such a keys as IME trigger,
  you will need to assign other keys (Control+o, Control+\, etc.)
